# Code of Conduct

To make clear what is expected, everyone participating in this project is required to conform to UBC DSCI 310's Code of Conduct.

We are committed to fostering an open, inclusive, and respectful environment for all participants in this project. We welcome individuals from all backgrounds and are dedicated to promoting a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. We believe that diversity and inclusivity leads to stronger, more effective teamwork in which all members feel safe, valued, and empowered to contribute.

We as members, contributors, and leaders do not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind and pledge to make participation in our community a safe and healthy experience.

All members of the DSCI 310 students and instructors are expected to assist with the enforcement of the Code of Conduct. All reports will be reviewed by the team and will be kept strictly confidential.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by UBC DSCI 310 students and instructors including, but not limited to, group meetings, email communication, pull request feedback, discussion boards (e.g. Github issues), social media, private messaging applications (e.g. Instagram) or other events where DSCI 310 is represented.

## A Statement on diversity and inclusivity

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity.

We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to, age, body size, visible or invisible disability, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, familial status, nationality, race, ethnicity, religion or belief (or lack thereof), personal appearance, genetic information or sexual identity and orientation.

## Expected behaviour

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Treating everyone with equal respect
- Being open to differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences

## Unacceptable behaviour

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants on any platform or at any event in which UBC DSCI 310 is represented include:

- Discriminatory, offensive, or harmful language with the effect of excluding people on the basis of membership of any specific group
- Bullying or intimidation of any kind, including but not limited to physical or verbal abuse, unwelcome attention, or stalking

## Consequences for unacceptable behaviour

Participants who are asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to comply immediately. This applies to any platform or event where UBC DSCI 310 is represented, either online or in-person. If a participant engages in behavior that violates the Code of Conduct, the team may warn the offender and or engage the DSCI 310 Instructor to investigate the Code of Conduct violation and impose appropriate sanctions. Consequences may include temporary or permanent removal from the project, bans from the project's communication channels (e.g. Github issues, emails, private messaging applications, etc.), and reports to appropriate authorities in cases of legal violations.

## Reporting and dealing with unacceptable behaviour

If someone violates the Code of Conduct on any platform or event where UBC DSCI 310 is represented, either online or in-person, we encourage you to report it promptly to the members of UBC DSCI 310. The primary members for this project is Nicholas Tam, email to: tsunlinicholastam[-at-]gmail.com.
